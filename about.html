		<h1>Emilio A. Escobar</h1>
		
		<p>You can find me on <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/eaescob">Twitter</a> or send an email to eescobar at gmail.</p>
	
		<p>I am currently a Lead Software Architect at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.safenet-inc.com">SafeNet Inc.</a> in Columbia, Maryland. I get to write and design the MDeX System Cross Domain platform.</p>
		<p>On my personal time, I am the core developer at <a target="_blank" href="http://ettercap.sourceforge.net">Ettercap</a>, where I am responsible for fixing bugs, adding new features such as plug-ins, decoders, and applying user-submitted patches.</p>

		<p>Besides hacking code in both places, I also do my own application security research as well as application/network penetration testing. I am heavily involved in the INFOSEC community and needed a place where I could write my rants and findings so here I am.</p>
