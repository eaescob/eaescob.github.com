After watching [Jayson Street's](https://twitter.com/jaysonstreet) keynote at [SkyDogCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iV8XQ1P9Co), it made it clear to me of the opportunity that the infosec community has right now. While things are not perfect (not that they'll ever be), businesses are paying more attention to their security programs and providing support to internal teams. This gives us (members of the community) a chance to really help make a change. And this is primarily around how we treat each other and allow newcomers to join and learn.

> We've fought against the business for years to listen to us. Now that we have their attention, we've decided to turn against each other?

The best part of a community is diversity. Having a diverse group of people only brings the best thinking forward. Different upbringings, gender, religions, nationality, etc., only opens our minds even more as the difference of opinions, new ideas, or different train of thoughts expands our horizons as a collective unit. Those elements bring to the table all different kinds of ideas that if combined together, they can solve problems that until now have been deemed as unsolvable.

## Everyone is different and unique in their own way

Just because someone is different, and by that I mean a minority in the community, does not mean they have nothing to say. It certainly gives no one the right to treat them like shit.

## What to do?

I believe that everyone has a part to play on fixing this. I call to my fellow CISOs to emphasize the point of unity and collaboration. We can teach security, the meaning of it and the concepts behind it. But what we cannot teach is personality, open their minds, and most of all, curiosity. People who join the community with an open mind and always looking for more are who will drive this community to a successful state.

## Why is this needed?

Companies are becoming more lean, technical, and want to move at a faster pace. This means that security can no longer be the policy book dropping team. We're not here to say 'no' to the business. Instead, we are here to say 'where do you want to go and how can we help?'.

Finding the right balance between innovation, collaboration, creative freedom and security is an amazing challenge. The only way we can achieve this is by being *one single community* working towards the same goal. This applies to a business and outside.

> Read, learn, explore, educate yourselves.

Never stop learning.
