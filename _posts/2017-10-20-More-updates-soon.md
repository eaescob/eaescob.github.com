title: I know I suck at blogging
---

I know I haven't posted much here. Honestly, I lost track of having a blog of my own while being busy with everything else. Will try to be more public and post more things as we continue to innovate things at [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com). I will be speaking at a few conferences including [Argyle CISO Leadership Forum](https://www.argyleforum.com/Events/2017-chief-information-security-officer-ciso-leadership-forum--los-angeles). Join us and find out how new technology poses a challenge to any security strategy and how security needs to change.


More soon.
